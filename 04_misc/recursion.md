## Recursion

Recursion is a way of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces and then putting those pieces back together.

Here's an example:
Let's say we have a list of numbers, and we want to find the sum of all the numbers in the list. We could do this by adding up the numbers one by one. But we can also use recursion to solve this problem.

Here's how:
First, we check if the list is empty. If it is, then we're done, and the sum is zero.

If the list is not empty, we take the first number in the list and add it to the sum of the rest of the numbers.

To find the sum of the rest of the numbers, we call the function again, but this time with a smaller list (all the numbers except the first one).

This process of calling the function again with a smaller version of the problem is called recursion.

			//Object Inheritance allows for new object constructors to inherit the properties and prototype functions of a previously created object.
			//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			// Creating a main object constructor function:
			function Book(name, author, year) {
				this.name = name;
				this.author = author;
				this.year = year;
			}

			// Adding a prototype function to the "Book" object constructor:
			Book.prototype.getSummary = function () {
				return `${this.name} was written by ${this.author} and was first published in ${this.year}`;
			};

			// Creating a second constructor function that inherits the properties of the "Book" constructor function:
			function Comic(name, author, year, rating) {
				// The call method is chained onto the "Book" class within the code block to allow the "Comic" class to inherit its properties and functions
				Book.call(this, name, author, year); // First parameter refers to the current object constructor
				this.rating = rating; // The new property "rating" for the "Comic" object constructor has its assignment conditions defined.
			}

			// Inheriting the prototype "getSummary()" from the Book constructor:
			Comic.prototype = Object.create(Book.prototype);

			// Changing the prototype constructor name from "Book()" to "Comic()":
			Comic.prototype.constructor = Comic;

			// Test logs:
			let comic1 = new Comic("Multiversity", "Grant Morrison", 2015, 7.5);
			console.log(comic1);
			console.log(comic1.getSummary());

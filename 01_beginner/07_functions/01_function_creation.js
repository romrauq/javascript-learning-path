// Functions are used to contain reusable sections of code.

// Defining a function named "myFunction":
function myFunction() {
	// function statements are written within the function's curly brackets:
	console.log("You have created a function!");
}

myFunction(); // Calling/executing the function.
// Calling/executing/running a function runs statements within it's curly brackets.

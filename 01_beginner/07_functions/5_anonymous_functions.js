// Anonymous functions are functions that are not given an identifying function name.

// Assigning an anonymous function to a variable named "unknown":
let unknown = function () {
	alert("You have created an anonymous function!");
};

unknown(); // Anonymous functions are called using the variable name that the function has been assigned to.

//In a regular function, the value of this is dynamically determined at runtime based on how the function is called.The this value is influenced by the context in which the function is invoked.For example:

function RegularFunction() {
	this.value = 42;

	this.getValue = function () {
		console.log(this.value);
	};
}

const obj = new RegularFunction();
const getValueMethod = obj.getValue;

// When invoked as a method, 'this' refers to the object (obj)
obj.getValue(); // Output: 42

// When invoked as a standalone function, 'this' may refer to the global object
getValueMethod(); // Output: undefined (or error in strict mode)

// In the second case (getValueMethod()), when the function is invoked as a standalone function, this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode). This dynamic behavior of this in regular functions can lead to unexpected results and requires careful handling, such as using methods like bind, call, or apply to explicitly set the desired this value.
